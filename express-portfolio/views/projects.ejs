        <h2 class="card-title">Advanced Networking Case Study – Ontario Tech University Network Design (2023)</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
            This project involved designing and implementing an enterprise-level network infrastructure
            at Ontario Tech University's main campus, situated in Oshawa. Two independent system
            configurations were connected by BGP within the network, and internal route management was
            handled by OSPF and EIGRP. Important duties included IP addressing, VLAN configurations,
            VRF deployment, and IPv4 and IPv6 routing protocol configuration. The project ensured that
            the university's North and Downtown campuses had full network access via dedicated ISP lines
            and WAN.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> OSPFv3 (IPv4 & IPv6), EIGRP (IPv4 & IPv6), BGP, Virtual Routing
            and Forwarding (VRF), VLANs, MPLS</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Advanced Networking II Case Study – MPLS WAN & DMVPN Configuration (2024)</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
            This project focused on building and constructing a wide-area network (WAN) infrastructure for
            Ontario Tech University's newly opened campuses in Toronto and Ottawa. The WAN was built using
            MPLS. The project also entailed configuring a switched LAN infrastructure for the Toronto
            campus and establishing secure connectivity across all campuses.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> MPLS, DMVPN, HSRPv2, EtherChannel (PAgP & LACP), IPSec for tunnel
            security, EIGRP Named Mode</p>
